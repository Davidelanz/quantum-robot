    "# Introduction to ``quantum-robot``\n",
    "\n",
    "``quantum-robot`` is a Python package for quantum-like perception modeling for robotics. The package exploits [Qiskit framework](https://qiskit.org/), implementing the models on quantum circuits which can be simulated on a classical computer or sent to a quantum backend (service provided by IBM Quantum Experience).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic components of ``quantum-robot`` are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- QUnits (the basic element of our architecture, processing sensory data returning processed outputs)\n",
    "- Models (the internal quantum model which define how the qUnit deals with input data)\n",
    "- Bursts (which define how the qUnit exploits the internal quantum model, providing the qUnit's output)\n",
