Logger
=========================================

The ``quantum-robot`` package stores logging information from
qUnits subprocesses and log them in text files.

.. note:: 
    The logs are stored in a ``.qrobot_logs`` folder
    in the current working directory in which the main python
    process is executed

.. automodule:: qrobot._logger
   :members: log_dir, log_file
